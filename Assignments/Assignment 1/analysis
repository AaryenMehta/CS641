According to the results of the frequency analysis (code given below), 'y' should be substituted by 'e'. Now if 'y' is 'e' then there must be a lot of 'the's.
And by looking at the text, we can see that there are a lot of occurences of the word 'mey'. So let us assume that 'm' is mapped to 't' and 'e' is mapped to 'h'.
we used similar observations to proceed. We also assumed that the punctuation marks were consistent with the original text. After a few tries we were not able
to figure out words if the spaces were consistent with the original text. So we assumed that the spaces were inconsistent and the pieces started falling into places.
